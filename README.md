## 📰 News
- **2025/05/17**: We have released our code and dataset.

## 📡 Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an automated negotiation system that simulates agent-to-agent negotiations in consumer markets. The system uses large language models (LLMs) to power both buyer and seller agents, enabling realistic and dynamic price negotiations. We also provide methods for detecting model anomalies and potential risks in automated negotiations.

## 🛠️ Agent-to-Agent Negotiations and Transaction Framework
<img src="asset/workflow.png" width="1000">

### Setup

1. Create a conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n negotiation python=3.9
conda activate negotiation
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up API keys in a `Config.py` file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key"
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = ["your_deepseek_api_key1", "your_deepseek_api_key2"]
ZHI_API_KEY = ["your_zhizengzeng_api_key1", "your_zhizengzeng_api_key2"]
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your_google_api_key"
```

### Usage

Run experiments using the provided shell script:
```bash
./run_all.sh
```

Or run individual experiments using main.py:
```bash
python main.py \
    --products-file dataset/products.json \
    --buyer-model gpt-3.5-turbo \
    --seller-model gpt-3.5-turbo \
    --summary-model gpt-3.5-turbo \
    --max-turns 30 \
    --num-experiments 1 \
    --output-dir results
```

### Budget Scenarios

The system tests five different budget scenarios for each product:
- High: Retail Price * 1.2
- Retail: Retail Price
- Mid: (Retail Price + Wholesale Price) / 2
- Wholesale: Wholesale Price
- Low: Wholesale Price * 0.8

### Supported Models
- OpenAI
- DeepSeek
- Qwen
- Google

### Results

Results are saved in the `results` directory with the following structure:
```
results/
└── seller_{seller_model}/
    └── {buyer_model}/
        └── product_{product_id}/
            └── budget_{scenario}/
                └── product_{product_id}_exp_{experiment_num}.json
```

Each result file contains:
- Complete conversation history
- Price offers
- Negotiation outcome
- Budget scenario
- Model information

### Main Result Analysis

In `data_postprocess/draw_result.ipynb`, we provide methods for calculating various metrics and generating visualizations, including:
- Price Reduction Rate
- Total Profit
- Deal Rate
- Profit Rate

### Model Anomaly Analysis

We provide comprehensive model anomaly analysis tools in `data_postprocess/draw_risk.ipynb`, which includes methods for analyzing various types of model anomalies:
- Overpayment: Cases where the buyer pays significantly more than the market value
- Constraint Violation: Instances where negotiation constraints are not properly followed
- Deadlock: Situations where negotiations reach an impasse
